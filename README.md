## Brief:
1. Companies use external registries such as Docker Hub which provides good service for private users and companies that are just starting but on an enterprise level, sometimes there may be budget constraints and other such problem which may hinder us to use Docker or other such platforms.
2. The Private VS Public Container Registry debate rages on: 
**Public registry services are basic, simple to use and can work well for individuals and smaller teams.** 
But once teams begin to scale up, they run into numerous issues with public registries, from a security standpoint to economical reasons, all of it becomes a hassle in public registry.
_**A private container registry with scanning capabilities and role-based access control offers more security, governance and efficient management.**_
3. There are further problems that can be solved with private container registries and the K8s community is finding them to such a neat solution for their images! 

## Acknowledgements:
1. I would like to thank DigitalOcean for their amazing opportunity where I got to dive into Kubernetes and found out a whole new learning curve to embark onto! Their Cloud Console is simple, fluid and beautiful to work with and I know this because I have worked with all the popular Cloud Platforms such as GCP, AWS and Azure.
3. The Kubernetes, Terraform and Trow Documentation was brilliant and on-point and very simple to follow, it guided me through parts where I was stuck and didn't know what to do.
4. Then there is the man **Olwi Mamduh** whose brilliant guide on how to automate this whole process with terraform guided me and helped me smoothly sail through the challenge!
